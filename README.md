# Remove godaddy malware

Recently I receive warnings from Go Daddy, where I have a website hosted, notifying me that my account got infected by many malwares.

I have no idea how these fake php pages came from (was my account hacked, or my password compromised? I don't know, but I have serious doubts about Go Daddy.)

![Go Daddy email](https://github.com/awojdyla/remove_godaddy_malware/blob/master/godaddy_email.png "Go Daddy email")

Anyway, I could never reach them, and they do not provide tools to perform the removal automatically, so I wrote a small jupyter notebook to automate this. This was a good exercise to become more familiar with ftp and python.

## How to use it
Copy and paste the content of the Go Daddy email they send you, with all the malwares, to file a named "list.txt".

Then open the jupyter notebook and run the code.

Use at your risk! Feel free to tinker around to understand what the code does

```python
from ftplib import FTP, error_perm

ftp = FTP(host=ftp_adress,user=user, passwd=passwd)

for line in open("list.txt",'r'):
    idx = line.find(" - ")+7 #remove characters
    file_to_delete = line[idx:-1].replace("\n","")
    if file_to_delete:
        print("trying to erase: "+ file_to_delete)
        try:
                ftp.delete(file_to_delete)
                print("\t deleted!")
        except error_perm:
            print("\t file does not exist or no permission")
        except BrokenPipeError:
            print("not connected! please reconnect")
